Taken from 4-5:30PM on September 9th, 2021 on a clear, sunny day using the Cannon Powershot mounted on the cart by PME.
Failed to take an image of 406C without the whiteboard marker. A copy of this is in the main folder as a placeholder - 
the image was taken in the plot, so is semi-usable but not automateable. On Sept 10th at 11AM, took a new image of 406C (with 
a whiteboard image, as well). Weather was again clear and sunny. This new image should be used instead.
